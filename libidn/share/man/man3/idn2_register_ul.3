.SH NAME
idn2_register_ul \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idn2.h>
.sp
.BI "int idn2_register_ul(const char * " ulabel ", const char * " alabel ", char ** " insertname ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * ulabel" 12
input zero\-terminated locale encoded string, or NULL.
.IP "const char * alabel" 12
input zero\-terminated ACE encoded string (xn\-\-), or NULL.
.IP "char ** insertname" 12
newly allocated output variable with name to register in DNS.
.IP "int flags" 12
optional \fBidn2_flags\fP to modify behaviour.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Perform IDNA2008 register string conversion on domain label  \fIulabel\fP and  \fIalabel\fP , as described in section 4 of RFC 5891.  Note that the
input  \fIulabel\fP is assumed to be encoded in the locale's default
coding system, and will be transcoded to UTF\-8 and NFC normalized
by this function.

It is recommended to supply both  \fIulabel\fP and  \fIalabel\fP for better
error checking, but supplying just one of them will work.  Passing
in only  \fIalabel\fP is better than only  \fIulabel\fP .  See RFC 5891 section
4 for more information.

After version 0.11:  \fIinsertname\fP may be NULL to test conversion of  \fIsrc\fP without allocating memory.
.SH "RETURNS"
On successful conversion \fBIDN2_OK\fP is returned, when the
given  \fIulabel\fP and  \fIalabel\fP does not match each other
\fBIDN2_UALABEL_MISMATCH\fP is returned, when either of the input
labels are too long \fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL\fP is returned, when  \fIalabel\fP does does not appear to be a proper A\-label \fBIDN2_INVALID_ALABEL\fP
is returned, or another error code is returned.
