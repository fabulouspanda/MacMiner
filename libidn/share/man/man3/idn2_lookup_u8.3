.SH NAME
idn2_lookup_u8 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idn2.h>
.sp
.BI "int idn2_lookup_u8(const uint8_t * " src ", uint8_t ** " lookupname ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const uint8_t * src" 12
input zero\-terminated UTF\-8 string in Unicode NFC normalized form.
.IP "uint8_t ** lookupname" 12
newly allocated output variable with name to lookup in DNS.
.IP "int flags" 12
optional \fBidn2_flags\fP to modify behaviour.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion on domain name  \fIsrc\fP , as
described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input string
must be encoded in UTF\-8 and be in Unicode NFC form.

Pass \fBIDN2_NFC_INPUT\fP in  \fIflags\fP to convert input to NFC form before
further processing.  \fBIDN2_TRANSITIONAL\fP and \fBIDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL\fP
do already imply \fBIDN2_NFC_INPUT\fP.
Pass \fBIDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP\fP in  \fIflags\fP to
convert any input A\-labels to U\-labels and perform additional
testing (not implemented yet).
Pass \fBIDN2_TRANSITIONAL\fP to enable Unicode TR46
transitional processing, and \fBIDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL\fP to enable
Unicode TR46 non\-transitional processing.  Multiple flags may be
specified by binary or:ing them together.

After version 2.0.3: \fBIDN2_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES\fP disabled by default.
Previously we were eliminating non\-STD3 characters from domain strings
such as _443._tcp.example.com, or IPs 1.2.3.4/24 provided to libidn2
functions. That was an unexpected regression for applications switching
from libidn and thus it is no longer applied by default.
Use \fBIDN2_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES\fP to enable that behavior again.

After version 0.11:  \fIlookupname\fP may be NULL to test lookup of  \fIsrc\fP without allocating memory.
.SH "RETURNS"
On successful conversion \fBIDN2_OK\fP is returned, if the
output domain or any label would have been too long
\fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN\fP or \fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL\fP is returned, or
another error code is returned.
