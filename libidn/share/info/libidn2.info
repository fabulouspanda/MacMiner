1 Introduction
**************

Libidn2 is a free software implementation of IDNA2008, Punycode and TR46
in the form a library.  It contains functionality to convert
internationalized domain names to and from ASCII Compatible Encoding
(ACE), following the IDNA2008 and TR46 standards.  It is available at
<https://gitlab.com/libidn/libidn2>.

   The library is a rewrite of the popular but legacy libidn library,
and is backwards (API) compatible with it.  See *note Converting from
libidn:: for more information.

   For technical reference on IDNA protocols, see
   • RFC 5890 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5890>),
   • RFC 5891 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>),
   • RFC 5892 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5892>),
   • RFC 5893 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5893>),
   • TR46 (<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/>).

   Libidn2 uses GNU libunistring
(<https://www.gnu.org/software/libunistring/>) for Unicode processing
and optionally GNU libiconv (<https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>)
for character set conversion.

   The library is dual-licensed under LGPLv3 or GPLv2, see the file
COPYING for detailed information.

2 Library Functions
*******************

Below are the interfaces of the Libidn2 library documented.

2.1 Header file ‘idn2.h’
========================

To use the functions documented in this chapter, you need to include the
file ‘idn2.h’ like this:

     #include <idn2.h>

2.2 Core Functions
==================

When you have the data encoded in UTF-8 form the direct interfaces to
the library are as follows.

idn2_to_ascii_8z
----------------

 -- Function: int idn2_to_ascii_8z (const char * INPUT, char ** OUTPUT,
          int FLAGS)
     INPUT: zero terminated input UTF-8 string.

     OUTPUT: pointer to newly allocated output string.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Convert UTF-8 domain name to ASCII string using the IDNA2008 rules.
     The domain name may contain several labels, separated by dots.  The
     output buffer must be deallocated by the caller.

     When unsure, it is recommended to call this function with the
     ‘IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL’ and ‘IDN2_NFC_INPUT’ flags.

     Return value: Returns ‘IDN2_OK’ on success, or error code.

     *Since:* 2.0.0

idn2_to_unicode_8z8z
--------------------

 -- Function: int idn2_to_unicode_8z8z (const char * INPUT, char **
          OUTPUT, int FLAGS)
     INPUT: Input zero-terminated UTF-8 string.

     OUTPUT: Newly allocated UTF-8 output string.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Converts a possibly ACE encoded domain name in UTF-8 format into a
     UTF-8 string (punycode decoding).  The output buffer will be
     zero-terminated and must be deallocated by the caller.

     ‘output’ may be NULL to test lookup of ‘input’ without allocating
     memory.

     *Since:* 2.0.0

idn2_lookup_u8
--------------

 -- Function: int idn2_lookup_u8 (const uint8_t * SRC, uint8_t **
          LOOKUPNAME, int FLAGS)
     SRC: input zero-terminated UTF-8 string in Unicode NFC normalized
     form.

     LOOKUPNAME: newly allocated output variable with name to lookup in
     DNS.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion on domain name ‘src’ , as
     described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input string
     must be encoded in UTF-8 and be in Unicode NFC form.

     Pass ‘IDN2_NFC_INPUT’ in ‘flags’ to convert input to NFC form
     before further processing.  ‘IDN2_TRANSITIONAL’ and
     ‘IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL’ do already imply ‘IDN2_NFC_INPUT’ .  Pass
     ‘IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP’ in ‘flags’ to convert any input A-labels to
     U-labels and perform additional testing (not implemented yet).
     Pass ‘IDN2_TRANSITIONAL’ to enable Unicode TR46 transitional
     processing, and ‘IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL’ to enable Unicode TR46
     non-transitional processing.  Multiple flags may be specified by
     binary or:ing them together.

     After version 2.0.3: ‘IDN2_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES’ disabled by
     default.  Previously we were eliminating non-STD3 characters from
     domain strings such as _443._tcp.example.com, or IPs 1.2.3.4/24
     provided to libidn2 functions.  That was an unexpected regression
     for applications switching from libidn and thus it is no longer
     applied by default.  Use ‘IDN2_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES’ to enable that
     behavior again.

     After version 0.11: ‘lookupname’ may be NULL to test lookup of
     ‘src’ without allocating memory.

     *Returns:* On successful conversion ‘IDN2_OK’ is returned, if the
     output domain or any label would have been too long
     ‘IDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN’ or ‘IDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL’ is returned, or
     another error code is returned.

     *Since:* 0.1

idn2_register_u8
----------------

 -- Function: int idn2_register_u8 (const uint8_t * ULABEL, const
          uint8_t * ALABEL, uint8_t ** INSERTNAME, int FLAGS)
     ULABEL: input zero-terminated UTF-8 and Unicode NFC string, or
     NULL.

     ALABEL: input zero-terminated ACE encoded string (xn–), or NULL.

     INSERTNAME: newly allocated output variable with name to register
     in DNS.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Perform IDNA2008 register string conversion on domain label
     ‘ulabel’ and ‘alabel’ , as described in section 4 of RFC 5891.
     Note that the input ‘ulabel’ must be encoded in UTF-8 and be in
     Unicode NFC form.

     Pass ‘IDN2_NFC_INPUT’ in ‘flags’ to convert input ‘ulabel’ to NFC
     form before further processing.

     It is recommended to supply both ‘ulabel’ and ‘alabel’ for better
     error checking, but supplying just one of them will work.  Passing
     in only ‘alabel’ is better than only ‘ulabel’ .  See RFC 5891
     section 4 for more information.

     After version 0.11: ‘insertname’ may be NULL to test conversion of
     ‘src’ without allocating memory.

     *Returns:* On successful conversion ‘IDN2_OK’ is returned, when the
     given ‘ulabel’ and ‘alabel’ does not match each other
     ‘IDN2_UALABEL_MISMATCH’ is returned, when either of the input
     labels are too long ‘IDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL’ is returned, when ‘alabel’
     does does not appear to be a proper A-label ‘IDN2_INVALID_ALABEL’
     is returned, or another error code is returned.

2.3 Locale Functions
====================

As a convenience, the following functions are provided that will convert
the input from the locale encoding format to UTF-8 and normalize the
string using NFC, and then apply the core functions described earlier.

idn2_to_ascii_lz
----------------

 -- Function: int idn2_to_ascii_lz (const char * INPUT, char ** OUTPUT,
          int FLAGS)
     INPUT: zero terminated input UTF-8 string.

     OUTPUT: pointer to newly allocated output string.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Convert a domain name in locale’s encoding to ASCII string using
     the IDNA2008 rules.  The domain name may contain several labels,
     separated by dots.  The output buffer must be deallocated by the
     caller.

     When unsure, it is recommended to call this function with the
     ‘IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL’ and ‘IDN2_NFC_INPUT’ flags.

     *Returns:* ‘IDN2_OK’ on success, or error code.  Same as described
     in ‘idn2_lookup_ul()’ documentation.

     *Since:* 2.0.0

idn2_to_unicode_8zlz
--------------------

 -- Function: int idn2_to_unicode_8zlz (const char * INPUT, char **
          OUTPUT, int FLAGS)
     INPUT: Input zero-terminated UTF-8 string.

     OUTPUT: Newly allocated output string in current locale’s character
     set.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Converts a possibly ACE encoded domain name in UTF-8 format into a
     string encoded in the current locale’s character set (punycode
     decoding).  The output buffer will be zero-terminated and must be
     deallocated by the caller.

     ‘output’ may be NULL to test lookup of ‘input’ without allocating
     memory.

     *Since:* 2.0.0

idn2_to_unicode_lzlz
--------------------

 -- Function: int idn2_to_unicode_lzlz (const char * INPUT, char **
          OUTPUT, int FLAGS)
     INPUT: Input zero-terminated string encoded in the current locale’s
     character set.

     OUTPUT: Newly allocated output string in current locale’s character
     set.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Converts a possibly ACE encoded domain name in the locale’s
     character set into a string encoded in the current locale’s
     character set (punycode decoding).  The output buffer will be
     zero-terminated and must be deallocated by the caller.

     ‘output’ may be NULL to test lookup of ‘input’ without allocating
     memory.

     *Since:* 2.0.0

idn2_lookup_ul
--------------

 -- Function: int idn2_lookup_ul (const char * SRC, char ** LOOKUPNAME,
          int FLAGS)
     SRC: input zero-terminated locale encoded string.

     LOOKUPNAME: newly allocated output variable with name to lookup in
     DNS.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion on domain name ‘src’ , as
     described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input is assumed
     to be encoded in the locale’s default coding system, and will be
     transcoded to UTF-8 and NFC normalized by this function.

     Pass ‘IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP’ in ‘flags’ to convert any input
     A-labels to U-labels and perform additional testing.  Pass
     ‘IDN2_TRANSITIONAL’ to enable Unicode TR46 transitional processing,
     and ‘IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL’ to enable Unicode TR46 non-transitional
     processing.  Multiple flags may be specified by binary or:ing them
     together, for example ‘IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP’ |
     ‘IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL’ .  The ‘IDN2_NFC_INPUT’ in ‘flags’ is always
     enabled in this function.

     After version 0.11: ‘lookupname’ may be NULL to test lookup of
     ‘src’ without allocating memory.

     *Returns:* On successful conversion ‘IDN2_OK’ is returned, if
     conversion from locale to UTF-8 fails then ‘IDN2_ICONV_FAIL’ is
     returned, if the output domain or any label would have been too
     long ‘IDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN’ or ‘IDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL’ is returned, or
     another error code is returned.

     *Since:* 0.1

idn2_register_ul
----------------

 -- Function: int idn2_register_ul (const char * ULABEL, const char *
          ALABEL, char ** INSERTNAME, int FLAGS)
     ULABEL: input zero-terminated locale encoded string, or NULL.

     ALABEL: input zero-terminated ACE encoded string (xn–), or NULL.

     INSERTNAME: newly allocated output variable with name to register
     in DNS.

     FLAGS: optional ‘idn2_flags’ to modify behaviour.

     Perform IDNA2008 register string conversion on domain label
     ‘ulabel’ and ‘alabel’ , as described in section 4 of RFC 5891.
     Note that the input ‘ulabel’ is assumed to be encoded in the
     locale’s default coding system, and will be transcoded to UTF-8 and
     NFC normalized by this function.

     It is recommended to supply both ‘ulabel’ and ‘alabel’ for better
     error checking, but supplying just one of them will work.  Passing
     in only ‘alabel’ is better than only ‘ulabel’ .  See RFC 5891
     section 4 for more information.

     After version 0.11: ‘insertname’ may be NULL to test conversion of
     ‘src’ without allocating memory.

     *Returns:* On successful conversion ‘IDN2_OK’ is returned, when the
     given ‘ulabel’ and ‘alabel’ does not match each other
     ‘IDN2_UALABEL_MISMATCH’ is returned, when either of the input
     labels are too long ‘IDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL’ is returned, when ‘alabel’
     does does not appear to be a proper A-label ‘IDN2_INVALID_ALABEL’
     is returned, or another error code is returned.

2.4 Control Flags
=================

The ‘flags’ parameter can take on the following values, or a bit-wise
inclusive or of any subset of the parameters:

 -- Global flag: idn2_flags IDN2_NFC_INPUT
     Apply NFC normalization on input.

 -- Global flag: idn2_flags IDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP
     Apply additional round-trip conversion of A-label inputs.

 -- Global flag: idn2_flags IDN2_TRANSITIONAL
     Perform Unicode TR46 transitional processing.

 -- Global flag: idn2_flags IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL
     Perform Unicode TR46 non-transitional processing.

2.5 Error Handling
==================

idn2_strerror
-------------

 -- Function: const char * idn2_strerror (int RC)
     RC: return code from another libidn2 function.

     Convert internal libidn2 error code to a humanly readable string.
     The returned pointer must not be de-allocated by the caller.

     Return value: A humanly readable string describing error.

idn2_strerror_name
------------------

 -- Function: const char * idn2_strerror_name (int RC)
     RC: return code from another libidn2 function.

     Convert internal libidn2 error code to a string corresponding to
     internal header file symbols.  For example,
     idn2_strerror_name(IDN2_MALLOC) will return the string
     "IDN2_MALLOC".

     The caller must not attempt to de-allocate the returned string.

     Return value: A string corresponding to error code symbol.

2.6 Return Codes
================

     Label has character forbidden in transitional mode (TR46).

 -- Return code: idn2_rc IDN2_INVALID_NONTRANSITIONAL

2.7 Memory Handling
===================

idn2_free
---------

 -- Function: void idn2_free (void * PTR)
     PTR: pointer to deallocate

     Call free(3) on the given pointer.

     This function is typically only useful on systems where the library
     malloc heap is different from the library caller malloc heap, which
     happens on Windows when the library is a separate DLL.

2.8 Version Check
=================

It is often desirable to check that the version of Libidn2 used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility
new features may have been introduced but due to problem with the
dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to
check that the version is okay right after program startup.

idn2_check_version
------------------

 -- Function: const char * idn2_check_version (const char * REQ_VERSION)
     REQ_VERSION: version string to compare with, or NULL.

     Check IDN2 library version.  This function can also be used to read
     out the version of the library code used.  See ‘IDN2_VERSION’ for a
     suitable ‘req_version’ string, it corresponds to the idn2.h header
     file version.  Normally these two version numbers match, but if you
     are using an application built against an older libidn2 with a
     newer libidn2 shared library they will be different.

     Return value: Check that the version of the library is at minimum
     the one given as a string in ‘req_version’ and return the actual
     version string of the library; return NULL if the condition is not
     met.  If NULL is passed to this function no check is done and only
     the version string is returned.

   The normal way to use the function is to put something similar to the
following first in your ‘main’:

       if (!idn2_check_version (IDN2_VERSION))
         {
           printf ("idn2_check_version() failed:\n"
                   "Header file incompatible with shared library.\n");
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

3 Converting from libidn
************************

This library is backwards (API) compatible with the libidn library
(<https://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/>).

   Although it is recommended for new software to use the native libidn2
functions (i.e., the ones prefixed with ‘idn2’), old software isn’t
always feasible to modify.

3.1 Converting with minimal modifications
=========================================

As such, libidn2, provides compatibility macros which switch all libidn
functions, to libidn2 functions in a backwards compatible way.  To take
advantage of these compatibility functions, it is sufficient to replace
the ‘idna.h’ header in legacy code, with ‘idn2.h’.  That would transform
the software from using libidn, i.e., IDNA2003, to using libidn2 with
IDNA2008 non-transitional encoding.

3.2 Converting to native APIs
=============================

However, it is recommended to switch applications to the IDN2 native
APIs.  The following table provides a mapping of libidn code snippets to
libidn2, for switching to IDNA2008.

libidn                        libidn2
                              
------------------------------------------------------------
rc = idna_to_ascii_8z (buf, &p, 0 /* any flags */);rc = idn2_to_ascii_8z (buf, &p, IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL);
if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS)       if (rc != IDN2_OK)
                              
rc = idna_to_unicode_8z8z (buf, &p, 0 /* any flags */);rc = idn2_to_unicode_8z8z (buf, &p, 0);
if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS)       if (rc != IDN2_OK)
                              

   Note that, although the table only lists the UTF-8 functions, the
mapping is identical for every other one on the family of toUnicode and
toAscii.  As the IDNA2003 details differ signicantly to IDNA2008, no
flags used in the libidn functions map to any specific flags; it is safe
to use the suggested libidn2 flags.

3.3 Converting with backwards compatibility
===========================================

In several cases where IDNA2008 mappings do not exist whereas IDNA2003
mappings do, software like browsers take a backwards compatible
approach.  That is convert the domain to IDNA2008 form, and if that
fails try the IDNA2003 conversion.  The following example demonstrates
that approach.

rc = idn2_to_ascii_8z (buf, &p, IDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL); /* IDNA2008 */
if (rc == IDN2_DISALLOWED)
  rc = idn2_to_ascii_8z (buf, &p, IDN2_TRANSITIONAL); /* IDNA2003 - compatible */

3.4 Using libidn and libidn2 code
=================================

In the special case of software that needs to support both libraries
(e.g., both IDNA2003 and IDNA2008), you must define
‘IDN2_SKIP_LIBIDN_COMPAT’ prior to including ‘idn2.h’ in order to be
able to use both libraries’ functions.

4.2 ToUnicode example
=====================

This example demonstrates how the library is used to convert ASCII
compatible names (ACE) to internationalized domain names.  Both input
and output are in UTF-8 form.

/* example-tounicode.c --- Example ToUnicode() code showing how to use Libidn2.
 *
 * This code is placed under public domain.
 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <idn2.h>		/* idn2_to_unicode_8z8z() */

/*
 * Compiling using pkg-config is recommended:
 *
 * $ cc -o example-to-unicode example-to-unicode.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libidn2)
 * $ ./example-tounicode
 * Input domain (ACE) encoded as `UTF-8': xn--nxasmm1c.com
 *
 * Read string (length 16): 78 6e 2d 2d 6e 78 61 73 6d 6d 31 63 2e 63 6f 6d
 * ACE label (length 14): 'βόλος.com'

5 Invoking idn2
***************

‘idn2’ translates internationalized domain names to the IDNA2008 encoded
format, either for lookup or registration.

   If strings are specified on the command line, they are used as input
and the computed output is printed to standard output ‘stdout’.  If no
strings are specified on the command line, the program read data, line
by line, from the standard input ‘stdin’, and print the computed output
to standard output.  What processing is performed (e.g., lookup or
register) is indicated by options.  If any errors are encountered, the
execution of the applications is aborted.

   All strings are expected to be encoded in the preferred charset used
by your locale.  Use ‘--debug’ to find out what this charset is.  On
POSIX systems you may use the ‘LANG’ environment variable to specify a
different locale.

   To process a string that starts with ‘-’, for example ‘-foo’, use
‘--’ to signal the end of parameters, as in ‘idn2 -r -- -foo’.

5.1 Options
===========

‘idn2’ recognizes these commands:

  -h, --help               Print help and exit

  -V, --version            Print version and exit

  -d, --decode             Decode (punycode) domain name

  -l, --lookup             Lookup domain name (default)

  -r, --register           Register label

  -T, --tr46t              Enable TR46 transitional processing

  -N, --tr46nt             Enable TR46 non-transitional processing

      --debug              Print debugging information

      --quiet              Silent operation

5.2 Environment Variables
=========================

On POSIX systems the LANG environment variable can be used to override
the system locale for the command being invoked.  The system locale may
influence what character set is used to decode data (i.e., strings on
the command line or data read from the standard input stream), and to
encode data to the standard output.  If your system is set up correctly,
however, the application will use the correct locale and character set
automatically.  Example usage:

     $ LANG=en_US.UTF-8 idn2
     ...

5.3 Examples
============

Standard usage, reading input from standard input and disabling license
and usage instructions:

     jas@latte:~$ idn2 --quiet
     räksmörgås.se
     xn--rksmrgs-5wao1o.se
     ...

   Reading input from the command line:

     jas@latte:~$ idn2 räksmörgås.se blåbærgrød.no
     xn--rksmrgs-5wao1o.se
     xn--blbrgrd-fxak7p.no
     jas@latte:~$

   Testing the IDNA2008 Register function:

     jas@latte:~$ idn2 --register fußball
     xn--fuball-cta
     jas@latte:~$

5.4 Troubleshooting
===================

Getting character data encoded right, and making sure Libidn2 use the
same encoding, can be difficult.  The reason for this is that most
systems may encode character data in more than one character encoding,
i.e., using ‘UTF-8’ together with ‘ISO-8859-1’ or ‘ISO-2022-JP’.  This
problem is likely to continue to exist until only one character encoding
come out as the evolutionary winner, or (more likely, at least to some
extents) forever.

   The first step to troubleshooting character encoding problems with
Libidn2 is to use the ‘--debug’ parameter to find out which character
set encoding ‘idn2’ believe your locale uses.

     jas@latte:~$ idn2 --debug --quiet ""
     Charset: UTF-8

     jas@latte:~$

   If it prints ‘ANSI_X3.4-1968’ (i.e., ‘US-ASCII’), this indicate you
have not configured your locale properly.  To configure the locale, you
can, for example, use ‘LANG=sv_SE.UTF-8; export LANG’ at a ‘/bin/sh’
prompt, to set up your locale for a Swedish environment using ‘UTF-8’ as
the encoding.

   Sometimes ‘idn2’ appear to be unable to translate from your system
locale into ‘UTF-8’ (which is used internally), and you will get an
error message like this:

     idn2: lookup: could not convert string to UTF-8

   One explanation is that you didn’t install the ‘iconv’ conversion
tools.  You can find it as a standalone library in GNU Libiconv
(<https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>).  On many GNU/Linux systems,
this library is part of the system, but you may have to install
additional packages to be able to use it.

   Another explanation is that the error is correct and you are feeding
‘idn2’ invalid data.  This can happen inadvertently if you are not
careful with the character set encoding you use.  For example, if your
shell run in a ‘ISO-8859-1’ environment, and you invoke ‘idn2’ with the
‘LANG’ environment variable as follows, you will feed it ‘ISO-8859-1’
characters but force it to believe they are ‘UTF-8’.  Naturally this
will lead to an error, unless the byte sequences happen to be valid
‘UTF-8’.  Note that even if you don’t get an error, the output may be
incorrect in this situation, because ‘ISO-8859-1’ and ‘UTF-8’ does not
in general encode the same characters as the same byte sequences.

     jas@latte:~$ idn2 --quiet --debug ""
     Charset: ISO-8859-1

     output[4] = 0xa4
     output[5] = 0x6b
     output[6] = 0x73
     output[7] = 0x6d
     output[8] = 0xc3
     output[9] = 0xb6
     output[10] = 0x72
     output[11] = 0x67
     output[12] = 0xc3
     output[13] = 0xa5
     output[14] = 0x73
     UCS-4 output[0] = U+0072
     UCS-4 output[1] = U+00e4
     UCS-4 output[2] = U+00e4
     UCS-4 output[3] = U+006b
     UCS-4 output[4] = U+0073
     UCS-4 output[5] = U+006d
     UCS-4 output[6] = U+00f6
     UCS-4 output[7] = U+0072
     UCS-4 output[8] = U+0067
     UCS-4 output[9] = U+00e5
     UCS-4 output[10] = U+0073
     xn--rksmrgs-5waap8p
     jas@latte:~$

   The sense moral here is to forget about ‘LANG’ (instead, configure
your system locale properly) unless you know what you are doing, and if
you want to use ‘LANG’, do it carefully and after verifying with
‘--debug’ that you get the desired results.
