<span id="objects"></span><h2>3.1. Objects, values and types<a class="headerlink" href="#objects-values-and-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-0"><em class="dfn">Objects</em> are Python&#8217;s abstraction for data.  All data in a Python program
is represented by objects or by relations between objects. (In a sense, and in
conformance to Von Neumann&#8217;s model of a &#8220;stored program computer,&#8221; code is also
represented by objects.)</p>
<p id="index-1">Every object has an identity, a type and a value.  An object&#8217;s <em>identity</em> never
changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object&#8217;s address in
memory.  The &#8216;<a class="reference internal" href="expressions.html#is"><tt class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">is</span></tt></a>&#8216; operator compares the identity of two objects; the
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#id" title="id"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">id()</span></tt></a> function returns an integer representing its identity (currently
implemented as its address). An object&#8217;s <em class="dfn">type</em> is also unchangeable. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a>
An object&#8217;s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., &#8220;does
it have a length?&#8221;) and also defines the possible values for objects of that
type.  The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#type" title="type"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">type()</span></tt></a> function returns an object&#8217;s type (which is an object
itself).  The <em>value</em> of some objects can change.  Objects whose value can
change are said to be <em>mutable</em>; objects whose value is unchangeable once they
are created are called <em>immutable</em>. (The value of an immutable container object
that contains a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter&#8217;s value
is changed; however the container is still considered immutable, because the
collection of objects it contains cannot be changed.  So, immutability is not
strictly the same as having an unchangeable value, it is more subtle.) An
object&#8217;s mutability is determined by its type; for instance, numbers, strings
and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and lists are mutable.</p>
<p id="index-2">Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable
they may be garbage-collected.  An implementation is allowed to postpone garbage
collection or omit it altogether &#8212; it is a matter of implementation quality
how garbage collection is implemented, as long as no objects are collected that
are still reachable.</p>
<div class="impl-detail compound">
<p><strong>CPython implementation detail:</strong> CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed
detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon
as they become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage
containing circular references.  See the documentation of the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/gc.html#module-gc" title="gc: Interface to the cycle-detecting garbage collector."><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">gc</span></tt></a>
module for information on controlling the collection of cyclic garbage.
Other implementations act differently and CPython may change.
Do not depend on immediate finalization of objects when they become
unreachable (ex: always close files).</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the use of the implementation&#8217;s tracing or debugging facilities may
keep objects alive that would normally be collectable. Also note that catching
an exception with a &#8216;<a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts.html#try"><tt class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">try</span></tt></a>...<a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts.html#except"><tt class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">except</span></tt></a>&#8216; statement may keep
objects alive.</p>
<p>Some objects contain references to &#8220;external&#8221; resources such as open files or
windows.  It is understood that these resources are freed when the object is
garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen,
such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource,
usually a <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">close()</span></tt> method. Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly
close such objects.  The &#8216;<a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts.html#try"><tt class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">try</span></tt></a>...<a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts.html#finally"><tt class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">finally</span></tt></a>&#8216; statement
provides a convenient way to do this.</p>
<p id="index-3">Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called <em>containers</em>.
Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries.  The references are
part of a container&#8217;s value.  In most cases, when we talk about the value of a
container, we imply the values, not the identities of the contained objects;
however, when we talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities
of the immediately contained objects are implied.  So, if an immutable container
(like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes if
that mutable object is changed.</p>
<p>Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior.  Even the importance of
object identity is affected in some sense: for immutable types, operations that
compute new values may actually return a reference to any existing object with
the same type and value, while for mutable objects this is not allowed.  E.g.,
after <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1;</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></tt> may or may not refer to the same object
with the value one, depending on the implementation, but after <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">[];</span> <span class="pre">d</span> <span class="pre">=</span>
<span class="pre">[]</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></tt> are guaranteed to refer to two different, unique, newly
created empty lists. (Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">d</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">[]</span></tt> assigns the same object to both
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></tt>.)</p>

cases, the exception <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions.html#exceptions.OverflowError" title="exceptions.OverflowError"><tt class="xref py py-exc docutils literal"><span class="pre">OverflowError</span></tt></a> is raised instead).  For the
purpose of shift and mask operations, integers are assumed to have a
binary, 2&#8217;s complement notation using 32 or more bits, and hiding no

correspond to different values).</p>

<p id="index-39">Methods also support accessing (but not setting) the arbitrary function
attributes on the underlying function object.</p>
<p>User-defined method objects may be created when getting an attribute of a class
(perhaps via an instance of that class), if that attribute is a user-defined
function object, an unbound user-defined method object, or a class method
object. When the attribute is a user-defined method object, a new method object
is only created if the class from which it is being retrieved is the same as, or
a derived class of, the class stored in the original method object; otherwise,
the original method object is used as it is.</p>
<p id="index-40">When a user-defined method object is created by retrieving a user-defined
function object from a class, its <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_self</span></tt> attribute is <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt>
and the method object is said to be unbound. When one is created by
retrieving a user-defined function object from a class via one of its
instances, its <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_self</span></tt> attribute is the instance, and the method
object is said to be bound. In either case, the new method&#8217;s
<tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_class</span></tt> attribute is the class from which the retrieval takes
place, and its <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_func</span></tt> attribute is the original function object.</p>
<p id="index-41">When a user-defined method object is created by retrieving another method object
from a class or instance, the behaviour is the same as for a function object,
except that the <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_func</span></tt> attribute of the new instance is not the
original method object but its <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_func</span></tt> attribute.</p>
<p id="index-42">When a user-defined method object is created by retrieving a class method object
from a class or instance, its <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_self</span></tt> attribute is the class itself (the
same as the <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_class</span></tt> attribute), and its <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_func</span></tt> attribute is
the function object underlying the class method.</p>
<p>When an unbound user-defined method object is called, the underlying function
(<tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_func</span></tt>) is called, with the restriction that the first argument must
be an instance of the proper class (<tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_class</span></tt>) or of a derived class
thereof.</p>
<p>When a bound user-defined method object is called, the underlying function
(<tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_func</span></tt>) is called, inserting the class instance (<tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_self</span></tt>) in
front of the argument list.  For instance, when <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></tt> is a class which
contains a definition for a function <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">f()</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> is an instance of
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></tt>, calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.f(1)</span></tt> is equivalent to calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C.f(x,</span> <span class="pre">1)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>When a user-defined method object is derived from a class method object, the
&#8220;class instance&#8221; stored in <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">im_self</span></tt> will actually be the class itself, so
that calling either <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.f(1)</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C.f(1)</span></tt> is equivalent to calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(C,1)</span></tt>
where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></tt> is the underlying function.</p>
<p class="last">Note that the transformation from function object to (unbound or bound) method
object happens each time the attribute is retrieved from the class or instance.
In some cases, a fruitful optimization is to assign the attribute to a local
variable and call that local variable. Also notice that this transformation only
happens for user-defined functions; other callable objects (and all non-callable
objects) are retrieved without transformation.  It is also important to note
that user-defined functions which are attributes of a class instance are not
converted to bound methods; this <em>only</em> happens when the function is an
attribute of the class.</p>

<span id="newstyle"></span><h2>3.3. New-style and classic classes<a class="headerlink" href="#new-style-and-classic-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Classes and instances come in two flavors: old-style (or classic) and new-style.</p>
<p>Up to Python 2.1, old-style classes were the only flavour available to the user.
The concept of (old-style) class is unrelated to the concept of type: if <em>x</em> is
an instance of an old-style class, then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.__class__</span></tt> designates the class of
<em>x</em>, but <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type(x)</span></tt> is always <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;type</span> <span class="pre">'instance'&gt;</span></tt>.  This reflects the fact
that all old-style instances, independently of their class, are implemented with
a single built-in type, called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">instance</span></tt>.</p>
<p>New-style classes were introduced in Python 2.2 to unify classes and types.  A
new-style class is neither more nor less than a user-defined type.  If <em>x</em> is an
instance of a new-style class, then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type(x)</span></tt> is typically the same as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.__class__</span></tt> (although this is not guaranteed - a new-style class instance is
permitted to override the value returned for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.__class__</span></tt>).</p>
<p>The major motivation for introducing new-style classes is to provide a unified
object model with a full meta-model.  It also has a number of practical
benefits, like the ability to subclass most built-in types, or the introduction
of &#8220;descriptors&#8221;, which enable computed properties.</p>
<p>For compatibility reasons, classes are still old-style by default.  New-style
classes are created by specifying another new-style class (i.e. a type) as a
parent class, or the &#8220;top-level type&#8221; <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#object" title="object"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">object</span></tt></a> if no other parent is
needed.  The behaviour of new-style classes differs from that of old-style
classes in a number of important details in addition to what <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#type" title="type"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">type()</span></tt></a>
returns.  Some of these changes are fundamental to the new object model, like
the way special methods are invoked.  Others are &#8220;fixes&#8221; that could not be
implemented before for compatibility concerns, like the method resolution order
in case of multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>While this manual aims to provide comprehensive coverage of Python&#8217;s class
mechanics, it may still be lacking in some areas when it comes to its coverage
of new-style classes. Please see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/newstyle/">http://www.python.org/doc/newstyle/</a> for
sources of additional information.</p>

<span id="specialnames"></span><h2>3.4. Special method names<a class="headerlink" href="#special-method-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-72">A class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special syntax
(such as arithmetic operations or subscripting and slicing) by defining methods
with special names. This is Python&#8217;s approach to <em class="dfn">operator overloading</em>,
allowing classes to define their own behavior with respect to language
operators.  For instance, if a class defines a method named <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__getitem__" title="object.__getitem__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getitem__()</span></tt></a>,
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> is an instance of this class, then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x[i]</span></tt> is roughly equivalent
to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.__getitem__(i)</span></tt> for old-style classes and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type(x).__getitem__(x,</span> <span class="pre">i)</span></tt>
for new-style classes.  Except where mentioned, attempts to execute an
operation raise an exception when no appropriate method is defined (typically
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions.html#exceptions.AttributeError" title="exceptions.AttributeError"><tt class="xref py py-exc docutils literal"><span class="pre">AttributeError</span></tt></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions.html#exceptions.TypeError" title="exceptions.TypeError"><tt class="xref py py-exc docutils literal"><span class="pre">TypeError</span></tt></a>).</p>
<p>When implementing a class that emulates any built-in type, it is important that
the emulation only be implemented to the degree that it makes sense for the
object being modelled.  For example, some sequences may work well with retrieval
of individual elements, but extracting a slice may not make sense.  (One example
of this is the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">NodeList</span></tt> interface in the W3C&#8217;s Document Object Model.)</p>

<p id="index-79">These are the so-called &#8220;rich comparison&#8221; methods, and are called for comparison

<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.__ge__(y)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>A rich comparison method may return the singleton <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NotImplemented</span></tt> if it does
not implement the operation for a given pair of arguments. By convention,
<tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">False</span></tt> and <tt class="xref docutils literal"><span class="pre">True</span></tt> are returned for a successful comparison. However, these
methods can return any value, so if the comparison operator is used in a Boolean
context (e.g., in the condition of an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> statement), Python will call
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#bool" title="bool"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">bool()</span></tt></a> on the value to determine if the result is true or false.</p>
<p>There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x==y</span></tt> does not imply that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x!=y</span></tt> is false.  Accordingly, when
defining <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__eq__" title="object.__eq__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__eq__()</span></tt></a>, one should also define <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__ne__" title="object.__ne__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__ne__()</span></tt></a> so that the
operators will behave as expected.  See the paragraph on <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__hash__" title="object.__hash__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__hash__()</span></tt></a> for
some important notes on creating <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-hashable"><em class="xref std std-term">hashable</em></a> objects which support
custom comparison operations and are usable as dictionary keys.</p>
<p>There are no swapped-argument versions of these methods (to be used when the
left argument does not support the operation but the right argument does);
rather, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__lt__" title="object.__lt__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__lt__()</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__gt__" title="object.__gt__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__gt__()</span></tt></a> are each other&#8217;s reflection,

<span id="descriptor-invocation"></span><h4>3.4.2.3. Invoking Descriptors<a class="headerlink" href="#invoking-descriptors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with &#8220;binding behavior&#8221;, one
whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor
protocol:  <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__get__" title="object.__get__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__get__()</span></tt></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__set__" title="object.__set__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__set__()</span></tt></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__delete__" title="object.__delete__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__delete__()</span></tt></a>. If any of
those methods are defined for an object, it is said to be a descriptor.</p>
<p>The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the
attribute from an object&#8217;s dictionary. For instance, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a.x</span></tt> has a lookup chain
starting with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a.__dict__['x']</span></tt>, then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type(a).__dict__['x']</span></tt>, and
continuing through the base classes of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type(a)</span></tt> excluding metaclasses.</p>
<p>However, if the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor
methods, then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor
method instead.  Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which
descriptor methods were defined and how they were called.  Note that descriptors
are only invoked for new style objects or classes (ones that subclass
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#object" title="object"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">object()</span></tt></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#type" title="type"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">type()</span></tt></a>).</p>
<p>The starting point for descriptor invocation is a binding, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a.x</span></tt>. How the
arguments are assembled depends on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></tt>:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Direct Call</dt>
<dd>The simplest and least common call is when user code directly invokes a
descriptor method:    <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.__get__(a)</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>Instance Binding</dt>
<dd>If binding to a new-style object instance, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a.x</span></tt> is transformed into the call:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type(a).__dict__['x'].__get__(a,</span> <span class="pre">type(a))</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>Class Binding</dt>
<dd>If binding to a new-style class, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A.x</span></tt> is transformed into the call:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A.__dict__['x'].__get__(None,</span> <span class="pre">A)</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>Super Binding</dt>
<dd>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></tt> is an instance of <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#super" title="super"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt></a>, then the binding <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super(B,</span>
<span class="pre">obj).m()</span></tt> searches <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">obj.__class__.__mro__</span></tt> for the base class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>
immediately preceding <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> and then invokes the descriptor with the call:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A.__dict__['m'].__get__(obj,</span> <span class="pre">obj.__class__)</span></tt>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For instance bindings, the precedence of descriptor invocation depends on the
which descriptor methods are defined.  A descriptor can define any combination
of <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__get__" title="object.__get__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__get__()</span></tt></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__set__" title="object.__set__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__set__()</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__delete__" title="object.__delete__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__delete__()</span></tt></a>.  If it does not
define <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__get__" title="object.__get__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__get__()</span></tt></a>, then accessing the attribute will return the descriptor
object itself unless there is a value in the object&#8217;s instance dictionary.  If
the descriptor defines <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__set__" title="object.__set__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__set__()</span></tt></a> and/or <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__delete__" title="object.__delete__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__delete__()</span></tt></a>, it is a data
descriptor; if it defines neither, it is a non-data descriptor.  Normally, data
descriptors define both <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__get__" title="object.__get__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__get__()</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__set__" title="object.__set__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__set__()</span></tt></a>, while non-data
descriptors have just the <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__get__" title="object.__get__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__get__()</span></tt></a> method.  Data descriptors with
<a class="reference internal" href="#object.__set__" title="object.__set__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__set__()</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__get__" title="object.__get__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__get__()</span></tt></a> defined always override a redefinition in an
instance dictionary.  In contrast, non-data descriptors can be overridden by
instances.</p>
<p>Python methods (including <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#staticmethod" title="staticmethod"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">staticmethod()</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#classmethod" title="classmethod"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">classmethod()</span></tt></a>) are
implemented as non-data descriptors.  Accordingly, instances can redefine and
override methods.  This allows individual instances to acquire behaviors that
differ from other instances of the same class.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#property" title="property"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">property()</span></tt></a> function is implemented as a data descriptor. Accordingly,
instances cannot override the behavior of a property.</p>

<p>By default, new-style classes are constructed using <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#type" title="type"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">type()</span></tt></a>. A class
definition is read into a separate namespace and the value of class name is
bound to the result of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type(name,</span> <span class="pre">bases,</span> <span class="pre">dict)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>When the class definition is read, if <em>__metaclass__</em> is defined then the
callable assigned to it will be called instead of <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#type" title="type"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">type()</span></tt></a>. This allows
classes or functions to be written which monitor or alter the class creation
process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Modifying the class dictionary prior to the class being created.</li>
<li>Returning an instance of another class &#8211; essentially performing the role of a
factory function.</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps will have to be performed in the metaclass&#8217;s <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__new__" title="object.__new__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__new__()</span></tt></a> method
&#8211; <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">type.__new__()</span></tt> can then be called from this method to create a class
with different properties.  This example adds a new element to the class

<span id="sequence-types"></span><h3>3.4.6. Emulating container types<a class="headerlink" href="#emulating-container-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following methods can be defined to implement container objects.  Containers
usually are sequences (such as lists or tuples) or mappings (like dictionaries),
but can represent other containers as well.  The first set of methods is used
either to emulate a sequence or to emulate a mapping; the difference is that for
a sequence, the allowable keys should be the integers <em>k</em> for which <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">k</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span>
<span class="pre">N</span></tt> where <em>N</em> is the length of the sequence, or slice objects, which define a
range of items. (For backwards compatibility, the method <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__getslice__" title="object.__getslice__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getslice__()</span></tt></a>
(see below) can also be defined to handle simple, but not extended slices.) It
is also recommended that mappings provide the methods <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">keys()</span></tt>,
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">values()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">items()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">has_key()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">get()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">clear()</span></tt>,
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">setdefault()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">iterkeys()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">itervalues()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">iteritems()</span></tt>,
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">popitem()</span></tt>, <a class="reference internal" href="../library/copy.html#module-copy" title="copy: Shallow and deep copy operations."><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">copy()</span></tt></a>, and <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">update()</span></tt> behaving similar
to those for Python&#8217;s standard dictionary objects.  The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/userdict.html#module-UserDict" title="UserDict: Class wrapper for dictionary objects."><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">UserDict</span></tt></a> module
provides a <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">DictMixin</span></tt> class to help create those methods from a base set
of <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__getitem__" title="object.__getitem__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getitem__()</span></tt></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__setitem__" title="object.__setitem__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__setitem__()</span></tt></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__delitem__" title="object.__delitem__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__delitem__()</span></tt></a>, and
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">keys()</span></tt>. Mutable sequences should provide methods <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">append()</span></tt>,
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">count()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">index()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">extend()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">insert()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop()</span></tt>,
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">remove()</span></tt>, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">reverse()</span></tt> and <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">sort()</span></tt>, like Python standard list
objects.  Finally, sequence types should implement addition (meaning
concatenation) and multiplication (meaning repetition) by defining the methods
<a class="reference internal" href="#object.__add__" title="object.__add__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__add__()</span></tt></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__radd__" title="object.__radd__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__radd__()</span></tt></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__iadd__" title="object.__iadd__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__iadd__()</span></tt></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__mul__" title="object.__mul__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__mul__()</span></tt></a>,

<a class="reference internal" href="#object.__coerce__" title="object.__coerce__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__coerce__()</span></tt></a> or other numerical operators.  It is recommended that both
mappings and sequences implement the <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__contains__" title="object.__contains__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__contains__()</span></tt></a> method to allow
efficient use of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">in</span></tt> operator; for mappings, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">in</span></tt> should be equivalent
of <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">has_key()</span></tt>; for sequences, it should search through the values.  It is
further recommended that both mappings and sequences implement the
<a class="reference internal" href="#object.__iter__" title="object.__iter__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__iter__()</span></tt></a> method to allow efficient iteration through the container; for
mappings, <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__iter__" title="object.__iter__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__iter__()</span></tt></a> should be the same as <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">iterkeys()</span></tt>; for

<p>Note the calls to <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#max" title="max"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">max()</span></tt></a>; these are necessary because of the handling of
negative indices before the <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__*slice__()</span></tt> methods are called.  When
negative indexes are used, the <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__*item__()</span></tt> methods receive them as
provided, but the <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__*slice__()</span></tt> methods get a &#8220;cooked&#8221; form of the index
values.  For each negative index value, the length of the sequence is added to
the index before calling the method (which may still result in a negative
index); this is the customary handling of negative indexes by the built-in
sequence types, and the <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__*item__()</span></tt> methods are expected to do this as
well.  However, since they should already be doing that, negative indexes cannot
be passed in; they must be constrained to the bounds of the sequence before
being passed to the <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__*item__()</span></tt> methods. Calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max(0,</span> <span class="pre">i)</span></tt>
conveniently returns the proper value.</p>

<p>This section used to document the rules for coercion.  As the language has
evolved, the coercion rules have become hard to document precisely; documenting
what one version of one particular implementation does is undesirable.  Instead,
here are some informal guidelines regarding coercion.  In Python 3, coercion
will not be supported.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">If the left operand of a % operator is a string or Unicode object, no coercion
takes place and the string formatting operation is invoked instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It is no longer recommended to define a coercion operation. Mixed-mode
operations on types that don&#8217;t define coercion pass the original arguments to
the operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">New-style classes (those derived from <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#object" title="object"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">object</span></tt></a>) never invoke the
<a class="reference internal" href="#object.__coerce__" title="object.__coerce__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__coerce__()</span></tt></a> method in response to a binary operator; the only time
<a class="reference internal" href="#object.__coerce__" title="object.__coerce__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__coerce__()</span></tt></a> is invoked is when the built-in function <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#coerce" title="coerce"><tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">coerce()</span></tt></a> is
called.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For most intents and purposes, an operator that returns <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NotImplemented</span></tt> is
treated the same as one that is not implemented at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Below, <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__op__()</span></tt> and <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__rop__()</span></tt> are used to signify the generic method
names corresponding to an operator; <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__iop__()</span></tt> is used for the
corresponding in-place operator.  For example, for the operator &#8216;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></tt>&#8216;,
<a class="reference internal" href="#object.__add__" title="object.__add__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__add__()</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__radd__" title="object.__radd__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__radd__()</span></tt></a> are used for the left and right variant of
the binary operator, and <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__iadd__" title="object.__iadd__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__iadd__()</span></tt></a> for the in-place variant.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Exception to the previous item: if the left operand is an instance of a built-in

the right operand&#8217;s <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__rop__()</span></tt> method is tried <em>before</em> the left operand&#8217;s
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__op__()</span></tt> method.</p>
<p>This is done so that a subclass can completely override binary operators.
Otherwise, the left operand&#8217;s <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__op__()</span></tt> method would always accept the
right operand: when an instance of a given class is expected, an instance of a
subclass of that class is always acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When either operand type defines a coercion, this coercion is called before that

the coercion returns an object of a different type for the operand whose
coercion is invoked, part of the process is redone using the new object.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When an in-place operator (like &#8216;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+=</span></tt>&#8216;) is used, if the left operand
implements <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__iop__()</span></tt>, it is invoked without any coercion.  When the
operation falls back to <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__op__()</span></tt> and/or <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__rop__()</span></tt>, the normal

coercion under the same conditions as other binary operations use it.</p>

<p>A <em class="dfn">context manager</em> is an object that defines the runtime context to be
established when executing a <a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts.html#with"><tt class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">with</span></tt></a> statement. The context manager
handles the entry into, and the exit from, the desired runtime context for the

<p id="index-96">Typical uses of context managers include saving and restoring various kinds of
global state, locking and unlocking resources, closing opened files, etc.</p>

<p>For old-style classes, special methods are always looked up in exactly the
same way as any other method or attribute. This is the case regardless of
whether the method is being looked up explicitly as in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x.__getitem__(i)</span></tt>
or implicitly as in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x[i]</span></tt>.</p>

<p>For new-style classes, implicit invocations of special methods are only guaranteed
to work correctly if defined on an object&#8217;s type, not in the object&#8217;s instance
dictionary.  That behaviour is the reason why the following code raises an
exception (unlike the equivalent example with old-style classes):</p>

<span class="nc">TypeError</span>: <span class="n-Identifier">object of type &#39;C&#39; has no len()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The rationale behind this behaviour lies with a number of special methods such
as <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__hash__" title="object.__hash__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__hash__()</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__repr__" title="object.__repr__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__repr__()</span></tt></a> that are implemented by all objects,
including type objects. If the implicit lookup of these methods used the
conventional lookup process, they would fail when invoked on the type object
itself:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__hash__</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">hash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nc">TypeError</span>: <span class="n-Identifier">descriptor &#39;__hash__&#39; of &#39;int&#39; object needs an argument</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Incorrectly attempting to invoke an unbound method of a class in this way is
sometimes referred to as &#8216;metaclass confusion&#8217;, and is avoided by bypassing
the instance when looking up special methods:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__hash__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">hash</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="go">True</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In addition to bypassing any instance attributes in the interest of
correctness, implicit special method lookup generally also bypasses the
<a class="reference internal" href="#object.__getattribute__" title="object.__getattribute__"><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getattribute__()</span></tt></a> method even of the object&#8217;s metaclass:</p>
