<p class="topic-title first">Abstract</p>
<p>This document shows how Python fits into the web.  It presents some ways
to integrate Python with a web server, and general practices useful for
developing web sites.</p>
</div>
<p>Programming for the Web has become a hot topic since the rise of &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;,
which focuses on user-generated content on web sites.  It has always been
possible to use Python for creating web sites, but it was a rather tedious task.
Therefore, many frameworks and helper tools have been created to assist
developers in creating faster and more robust sites.  This HOWTO describes
some of the methods used to combine Python with a web server to create
dynamic content.  It is not meant as a complete introduction, as this topic is
far too broad to be covered in one single document.  However, a short overview
of the most popular libraries is provided.</p>
<div class="admonition-see-also admonition seealso">
<p class="first admonition-title">See also</p>
<p class="last">While this HOWTO tries to give an overview of Python in the web, it cannot
always be as up to date as desired.  Web development in Python is rapidly
moving forward, so the wiki page on <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebProgramming">Web Programming</a> may be more in sync with
recent development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-low-level-view">
<h2>The Low-Level View<a class="headerlink" href="#the-low-level-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When a user enters a web site, their browser makes a connection to the site&#8217;s
web server (this is called the <em>request</em>).  The server looks up the file in the
file system and sends it back to the user&#8217;s browser, which displays it (this is
the <em>response</em>).  This is roughly how the underlying protocol, HTTP, works.</p>
<p>Dynamic web sites are not based on files in the file system, but rather on
programs which are run by the web server when a request comes in, and which
<em>generate</em> the content that is returned to the user.  They can do all sorts of
useful things, like display the postings of a bulletin board, show your email,
configure software, or just display the current time.  These programs can be
written in any programming language the server supports.  Since most servers
support Python, it is easy to use Python to create dynamic web sites.</p>
<p>Most HTTP servers are written in C or C++, so they cannot execute Python code
directly &#8211; a bridge is needed between the server and the program.  These
bridges, or rather interfaces, define how programs interact with the server.
There have been numerous attempts to create the best possible interface, but
there are only a few worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Not every web server supports every interface.  Many web servers only support
old, now-obsolete interfaces; however, they can often be extended using
third-party modules to support newer ones.</p>
<div class="section" id="common-gateway-interface">
<h3>Common Gateway Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#common-gateway-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This interface, most commonly referred to as &#8220;CGI&#8221;, is the oldest, and is
supported by nearly every web server out of the box.  Programs using CGI to
communicate with their web server need to be started by the server for every
request.  So, every request starts a new Python interpreter &#8211; which takes some
time to start up &#8211; thus making the whole interface only usable for low load
situations.</p>
<p>The upside of CGI is that it is simple &#8211; writing a Python program which uses
CGI is a matter of about three lines of code.  This simplicity comes at a
price: it does very few things to help the developer.</p>
<p>Writing CGI programs, while still possible, is no longer recommended.  With
<a class="reference internal" href="#wsgi"><em>WSGI</em></a>, a topic covered later in this document, it is possible to write
programs that emulate CGI, so they can be run as CGI if no better option is
available.</p>
<div class="admonition-see-also admonition seealso">
<p class="first admonition-title">See also</p>
<p>The Python standard library includes some modules that are helpful for
creating plain CGI programs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="../library/cgi.html#module-cgi" title="cgi: Helpers for running Python scripts via the Common Gateway Interface."><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">cgi</span></tt></a> &#8211; Handling of user input in CGI scripts</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="../library/cgitb.html#module-cgitb" title="cgitb: Configurable traceback handler for CGI scripts."><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">cgitb</span></tt></a> &#8211; Displays nice tracebacks when errors happen in CGI
applications, instead of presenting a &#8220;500 Internal Server Error&#8221; message</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">The Python wiki features a page on <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/CgiScripts">CGI scripts</a> with some additional information
about CGI in Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simple-script-for-testing-cgi">
<h4>Simple script for testing CGI<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-script-for-testing-cgi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To test whether your web server works with CGI, you can use this short and
simple CGI program:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>
<span class="c"># -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-</span>

<span class="c"># enable debugging</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">cgitb</span>
<span class="n">cgitb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enable</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8&quot;</span>
<span class="k">print</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Depending on your web server configuration, you may need to save this code with
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.py</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.cgi</span></tt> extension.  Additionally, this file may also need to be
in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cgi-bin</span></tt> folder, for security reasons.</p>
<p>You might wonder what the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cgitb</span></tt> line is about.  This line makes it possible
to display a nice traceback instead of just crashing and displaying an &#8220;Internal
Server Error&#8221; in the user&#8217;s browser.  This is useful for debugging, but it might
risk exposing some confidential data to the user.  You should not use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cgitb</span></tt>
in production code for this reason.  You should <em>always</em> catch exceptions, and
display proper error pages &#8211; end-users don&#8217;t like to see nondescript &#8220;Internal
Server Errors&#8221; in their browsers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-cgi-on-your-own-server">
<h4>Setting up CGI on your own server<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-cgi-on-your-own-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have your own web server, this does not apply to you.  You can
check whether it works as-is, and if not you will need to talk to the
administrator of your web server. If it is a big host, you can try filing a
ticket asking for Python support.</p>
<p>If you are your own administrator or want to set up CGI for testing purposes on
your own computers, you have to configure it by yourself.  There is no single
way to configure CGI, as there are many web servers with different
configuration options.  Currently the most widely used free web server is
<a class="reference external" href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTPd</a>, or Apache for short. Apache can be
easily installed on nearly every system using the system&#8217;s package management
tool.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lighttpd.net">lighttpd</a> is another alternative and is
said to have better performance.  On many systems this server can also be
installed using the package management tool, so manually compiling the web
server may not be needed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On Apache you can take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/cgi.html">Dynamic Content with CGI</a> tutorial, where everything
is described.  Most of the time it is enough just to set <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+ExecCGI</span></tt>.  The
tutorial also describes the most common gotchas that might arise.</li>
<li>On lighttpd you need to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://redmine.lighttpd.net/wiki/lighttpd/Docs:ModCGI">CGI module</a>, which can be configured
in a straightforward way.  It boils down to setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cgi.assign</span></tt> properly.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="common-problems-with-cgi-scripts">
<h4>Common problems with CGI scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#common-problems-with-cgi-scripts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Using CGI sometimes leads to small annoyances while trying to get these
scripts to run.  Sometimes a seemingly correct script does not work as
expected, the cause being some small hidden problem that&#8217;s difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Some of these potential problems are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Python script is not marked as executable.  When CGI scripts are not
executable most web servers will let the user download it, instead of
running it and sending the output to the user.  For CGI scripts to run
properly on Unix-like operating systems, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+x</span></tt> bit needs to be set.
Using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chmod</span> <span class="pre">a+x</span> <span class="pre">your_script.py</span></tt> may solve this problem.</li>
<li>On a Unix-like system, The line endings in the program file must be Unix
style line endings.  This is important because the web server checks the
first line of the script (called shebang) and tries to run the program
specified there.  It gets easily confused by Windows line endings (Carriage
Return &amp; Line Feed, also called CRLF), so you have to convert the file to
Unix line endings (only Line Feed, LF).  This can be done automatically by
uploading the file via FTP in text mode instead of binary mode, but the
preferred way is just telling your editor to save the files with Unix line
endings.  Most editors support this.</li>
<li>Your web server must be able to read the file, and you need to make sure the
permissions are correct.  On unix-like systems, the server often runs as user
and group <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">www-data</span></tt>, so it might be worth a try to change the file
ownership, or making the file world readable by using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chmod</span> <span class="pre">a+r</span>
<span class="pre">your_script.py</span></tt>.</li>
<li>The web server must know that the file you&#8217;re trying to access is a CGI script.
Check the configuration of your web server, as it may be configured
to expect a specific file extension for CGI scripts.</li>
<li>On Unix-like systems, the path to the interpreter in the shebang
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#!/usr/bin/env</span> <span class="pre">python</span></tt>) must be correct.  This line calls
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/bin/env</span></tt> to find Python, but it will fail if there is no
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/bin/env</span></tt>, or if Python is not in the web server&#8217;s path.  If you know
where your Python is installed, you can also use that full path.  The
commands <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">whereis</span> <span class="pre">python</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type</span> <span class="pre">-p</span> <span class="pre">python</span></tt> could help you find
where it is installed.  Once you know the path, you can change the shebang
accordingly: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#!/usr/bin/python</span></tt>.</li>
<li>The file must not contain a BOM (Byte Order Mark). The BOM is meant for
determining the byte order of UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, but some editors
write this also into UTF-8 files.  The BOM interferes with the shebang line,
so be sure to tell your editor not to write the BOM.</li>
<li>If the web server is using <a class="reference internal" href="#mod-python"><em>mod_python</em></a>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> may be having
problems.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> is able to handle CGI scripts by itself, but it can
also be a source of issues.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mod-python">
<span id="id1"></span><h3>mod_python<a class="headerlink" href="#mod-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>People coming from PHP often find it hard to grasp how to use Python in the web.
Their first thought is mostly <a class="reference external" href="http://www.modpython.org/">mod_python</a>,
because they think that this is the equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_php</span></tt>.  Actually, there
are many differences.  What <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> does is embed the interpreter into
the Apache process, thus speeding up requests by not having to start a Python
interpreter for each request.  On the other hand, it is not &#8220;Python intermixed
with HTML&#8221; in the way that PHP is often intermixed with HTML. The Python
equivalent of that is a template engine.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> itself is much more
powerful and provides more access to Apache internals.  It can emulate CGI,
work in a &#8220;Python Server Pages&#8221; mode (similar to JSP) which is &#8220;HTML
intermingled with Python&#8221;, and it has a &#8220;Publisher&#8221; which designates one file
to accept all requests and decide what to do with them.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> does have some problems.  Unlike the PHP interpreter, the Python
interpreter uses caching when executing files, so changes to a file will
require the web server to be restarted.  Another problem is the basic concept
&#8211; Apache starts child processes to handle the requests, and unfortunately
every child process needs to load the whole Python interpreter even if it does
not use it.  This makes the whole web server slower.  Another problem is that,
because <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> is linked against a specific version of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libpython</span></tt>,
it is not possible to switch from an older version to a newer (e.g. 2.4 to 2.5)
without recompiling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt>.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> is also bound to the Apache
web server, so programs written for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> cannot easily run on other
web servers.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> should be avoided when writing new
programs.  In some circumstances it still might be a good idea to use
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> for deployment, but WSGI makes it possible to run WSGI programs
under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt> as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fastcgi-and-scgi">
<h3>FastCGI and SCGI<a class="headerlink" href="#fastcgi-and-scgi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>FastCGI and SCGI try to solve the performance problem of CGI in another way.
Instead of embedding the interpreter into the web server, they create
long-running background processes. There is still a module in the web server
which makes it possible for the web server to &#8220;speak&#8221; with the background
process.  As the background process is independent of the server, it can be
written in any language, including Python.  The language just needs to have a
library which handles the communication with the webserver.</p>
<p>The difference between FastCGI and SCGI is very small, as SCGI is essentially
just a &#8220;simpler FastCGI&#8221;.  As the web server support for SCGI is limited,
most people use FastCGI instead, which works the same way.  Almost everything
that applies to SCGI also applies to FastCGI as well, so we&#8217;ll only cover
the latter.</p>
<p>These days, FastCGI is never used directly.  Just like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod_python</span></tt>, it is only
used for the deployment of WSGI applications.</p>

applications.  It makes the deployment of WSGI applications much easier than
deployment using other low level methods, which need glue code.  The downside
is that mod_wsgi is limited to the Apache web server; other servers would need
their own implementations of mod_wsgi.</p>
<p>mod_wsgi supports two modes: embedded mode, in which it integrates with the
Apache process, and daemon mode, which is more FastCGI-like.  Unlike FastCGI,
mod_wsgi handles the worker-processes by itself, which makes administration
easier.</p>

<span id="wsgi"></span><h2>Step back: WSGI<a class="headerlink" href="#step-back-wsgi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>WSGI has already been mentioned several times, so it has to be something
important.  In fact it really is, and now it is time to explain it.</p>
<p>The <em>Web Server Gateway Interface</em>,  or WSGI for short, is defined in
<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="pep reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333"><strong>PEP 333</strong></a> and is currently the best way to do Python web programming.  While
it is great for programmers writing frameworks, a normal web developer does not
need to get in direct contact with it.  When choosing a framework for web
development it is a good idea to choose one which supports WSGI.</p>
<p>The big benefit of WSGI is the unification of the application programming
interface.  When your program is compatible with WSGI &#8211; which at the outer
level means that the framework you are using has support for WSGI &#8211; your
program can be deployed via any web server interface for which there are WSGI
wrappers.  You do not need to care about whether the application user uses
mod_python or FastCGI or mod_wsgi &#8211; with WSGI your application will work on
any gateway interface.  The Python standard library contains its own WSGI
server, <a class="reference internal" href="../library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref" title="wsgiref: WSGI Utilities and Reference Implementation."><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">wsgiref</span></tt></a>, which is a small web server that can be used for
testing.</p>
<p>A really great WSGI feature is middleware.  Middleware is a layer around your
program which can add various functionality to it.  There is quite a bit of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wsgi.org/en/latest/libraries.html">middleware</a> already
available.  For example, instead of writing your own session management (HTTP
is a stateless protocol, so to associate multiple HTTP requests with a single
user your application must create and manage such state via a session), you can
just download middleware which does that, plug it in, and get on with coding
the unique parts of your application.  The same thing with compression &#8211; there
is existing middleware which handles compressing your HTML using gzip to save
on your server&#8217;s bandwidth.  Authentication is another a problem easily solved
using existing middleware.</p>
<p>Although WSGI may seem complex, the initial phase of learning can be very
rewarding because WSGI and the associated middleware already have solutions to
many problems that might arise while developing web sites.</p>

<h3>WSGI Servers<a class="headerlink" href="#wsgi-servers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The code that is used to connect to various low level gateways like CGI or
mod_python is called a <em>WSGI server</em>.  One of these servers is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flup</span></tt>, which
supports FastCGI and SCGI, as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_JServ_Protocol">AJP</a>.  Some of these servers
are written in Python, as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flup</span></tt> is, but there also exist others which are
written in C and can be used as drop-in replacements.</p>
<p>There are many servers already available, so a Python web application

compared with other web technologies.</p>

<p>What does WSGI give the web application developer?  Let&#8217;s take a look at
an application that&#8217;s been around for a while, which was written in
Python without using WSGI.</p>
<p>One of the most widely used wiki software packages is <a class="reference external" href="http://moinmo.in/">MoinMoin</a>.  It was created in 2000, so it predates WSGI by about
three years.  Older versions needed separate code to run on CGI, mod_python,
FastCGI and standalone.</p>
<p>It now includes support for WSGI.  Using WSGI, it is possible to deploy
MoinMoin on any WSGI compliant server, with no additional glue code.
Unlike the pre-WSGI versions, this could include WSGI servers that the
authors of MoinMoin know nothing about.</p>

<div class="section" id="model-view-controller">
<h2>Model-View-Controller<a class="headerlink" href="#model-view-controller" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The term <em>MVC</em> is often encountered in statements such as &#8220;framework <em>foo</em>
supports MVC&#8221;.  MVC is more about the overall organization of code, rather than
any particular API.  Many web frameworks use this model to help the developer
bring structure to their program.  Bigger web applications can have lots of
code, so it is a good idea to have an effective structure right from the beginning.
That way, even users of other frameworks (or even other languages, since MVC is
not Python-specific) can easily understand the code, given that they are
already familiar with the MVC structure.</p>
<p>MVC stands for three components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>model</em>.  This is the data that will be displayed and modified.  In
Python frameworks, this component is often represented by the classes used by
an object-relational mapper.</li>
<li>The <em>view</em>.  This component&#8217;s job is to display the data of the model to the
user.  Typically this component is implemented via templates.</li>
<li>The <em>controller</em>.  This is the layer between the user and the model.  The
controller reacts to user actions (like opening some specific URL), tells
the model to modify the data if necessary, and tells the view code what to
display,</li>
</ul>
<p>While one might think that MVC is a complex design pattern, in fact it is not.
It is used in Python because it has turned out to be useful for creating clean,
maintainable web sites.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">While not all Python frameworks explicitly support MVC, it is often trivial
to create a web site which uses the MVC pattern by separating the data logic
(the model) from the user interaction logic (the controller) and the
templates (the view).  That&#8217;s why it is important not to write unnecessary
Python code in the templates &#8211; it works against the MVC model and creates
chaos in the code base, making it harder to understand and modify.</p>

these exist for all web frameworks in all languages.  Developers are not forced

<div class="section" id="templates">
<h3>Templates<a class="headerlink" href="#templates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mixing of HTML and Python code is made possible by a few libraries.  While
convenient at first, it leads to horribly unmaintainable code.  That&#8217;s why
templates exist.  Templates are, in the simplest case, just HTML files with
placeholders.  The HTML is sent to the user&#8217;s browser after filling in the
placeholders.</p>
<p>Python already includes two ways to build simple templates:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">template</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s">!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To generate complex HTML based on non-trivial model data, conditional
and looping constructs like Python&#8217;s <em>for</em> and <em>if</em> are generally needed.
<em>Template engines</em> support templates of this complexity.</p>
<p>There are a lot of template engines available for Python which can be used with
or without a <a class="reference internal" href="#framework">framework</a>.  Some of these define a plain-text programming
language which is easy to learn, partly because it is limited in scope.
Others use XML, and the template output is guaranteed to be always be valid
XML.  There are many other variations.</p>
<p>Some <a class="reference internal" href="#frameworks">frameworks</a> ship their own template engine or recommend one in
particular.  In the absence of a reason to use a different template engine,
using the one provided by or recommended by the framework is a good idea.</p>
<p>Popular template engines include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">Mako</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://genshi.edgewall.org/">Genshi</a></li>

<div class="admonition-see-also admonition seealso">

<p class="last">There are many template engines competing for attention, because it is
pretty easy to create them in Python.  The page <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating">Templating</a> in the wiki lists a big,
ever-growing number of these.  The three listed above are considered &#8220;second
generation&#8221; template engines and are a good place to start.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-persistence">
<h3>Data persistence<a class="headerlink" href="#data-persistence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Data persistence</em>, while sounding very complicated, is just about storing data.
This data might be the text of blog entries, the postings on a bulletin board or
the text of a wiki page.  There are, of course, a number of different ways to store
information on a web server.</p>
<p>Often, relational database engines like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> are used because of their good
performance when handling very large databases consisting of millions of
entries.  There is also a small database engine called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, which is bundled with Python in the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3" title="sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x."><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlite3</span></tt></a>
module, and which uses only one file.  It has no other dependencies.  For
smaller sites SQLite is just enough.</p>
<p>Relational databases are <em>queried</em> using a language called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>.  Python programmers in general do not
like SQL too much, as they prefer to work with objects.  It is possible to save
Python objects into a database using a technology called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> (Object Relational
Mapping).  ORM translates all object-oriented access into SQL code under the
hood, so the developer does not need to think about it.  Most <a class="reference internal" href="#frameworks">frameworks</a> use
ORMs, and it works quite well.</p>
<p>A second possibility is storing data in normal, plain text files (some
times called &#8220;flat files&#8221;).  This is very easy for simple sites,
but can be difficult to get right if the web site is performing many
updates to the stored data.</p>
<p>A third possibility are object oriented databases (also called &#8220;object
databases&#8221;).  These databases store the object data in a form that closely
parallels the way the objects are structured in memory during program
execution.  (By contrast, ORMs store the object data as rows of data in tables
and relations between those rows.)  Storing the objects directly has the
advantage that nearly all objects can be saved in a straightforward way, unlike
in relational databases where some objects are very hard to represent.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#frameworks">Frameworks</a> often give hints on which data storage method to choose.  It is
usually a good idea to stick to the data store recommended by the framework
unless the application has special requirements better satisfied by an
alternate storage mechanism.</p>

<div class="section" id="frameworks">
<span id="framework"></span><h2>Frameworks<a class="headerlink" href="#frameworks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The process of creating code to run web sites involves writing code to provide
various services.  The code to provide a particular service often works the
same way regardless of the complexity or purpose of the web site in question.
Abstracting these common solutions into reusable code produces what are called
&#8220;frameworks&#8221; for web development.  Perhaps the most well-known framework for
web development is Ruby on Rails, but Python has its own frameworks.  Some of
these were partly inspired by Rails, or borrowed ideas from Rails, but many
existed a long time before Rails.</p>
<p>Originally Python web frameworks tended to incorporate all of the services
needed to develop web sites as a giant, integrated set of tools.  No two web
frameworks were interoperable:  a program developed for one could not be
deployed on a different one without considerable re-engineering work.  This led
to the development of &#8220;minimalist&#8221; web frameworks that provided just the tools
to communicate between the Python code and the http protocol, with all other
services to be added on top via separate components.  Some ad hoc standards
were developed that allowed for limited interoperability between frameworks,
such as a standard that allowed different template engines to be used
interchangeably.</p>
<p>Since the advent of WSGI, the Python web framework world has been evolving
toward interoperability based on the WSGI standard.  Now many web frameworks,
whether &#8220;full stack&#8221; (providing all the tools one needs to deploy the most
complex web sites) or minimalist, or anything in between, are built from
collections of reusable components that can be used with more than one
framework.</p>
<p>The majority of users will probably want to select a &#8220;full stack&#8221; framework
that has an active community.  These frameworks tend to be well documented,
and provide the easiest path to producing a fully functional web site in
minimal time.</p>
<div class="section" id="some-notable-frameworks">
<h3>Some notable frameworks<a class="headerlink" href="#some-notable-frameworks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are an incredible number of frameworks, so they cannot all be covered

<div class="section" id="django">
<h4>Django<a class="headerlink" href="#django" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a framework consisting of several
tightly coupled elements which were written from scratch and work together very
well.  It includes an ORM which is quite powerful while being simple to use,
and has a great online administration interface which makes it possible to edit
the data in the database with a browser.  The template engine is text-based and
is designed to be usable for page designers who cannot write Python.  It
supports template inheritance and filters (which work like Unix pipes).  Django
has many handy features bundled, such as creation of RSS feeds or generic views,
which make it possible to create web sites almost without writing any Python code.</p>
<p>It has a big, international community, the members of which have created many
web sites.  There are also a lot of add-on projects which extend Django&#8217;s normal
functionality.  This is partly due to Django&#8217;s well written <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/">online

<div class="section" id="turbogears">
<h4>TurboGears<a class="headerlink" href="#turbogears" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Another popular web framework for Python is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a>.  TurboGears takes the approach of using already
existing components and combining them with glue code to create a seamless
experience.  TurboGears gives the user flexibility in choosing components. For
example the ORM and template engine can be changed to use packages different
from those used by default.</p>
<p>The documentation can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.turbogears.org/">TurboGears wiki</a>, where links to screencasts can be found.
TurboGears has also an active user community which can respond to most related
questions.  There is also a <a class="reference external" href="http://turbogearsbook.com/">TurboGears book</a>
published, which is a good starting point.</p>
<p>The newest version of TurboGears, version 2.0, moves even further in direction
of WSGI support and a component-based architecture.  TurboGears 2 is based on
the WSGI stack of another popular component-based web framework, <a class="reference external" href="http://pylonshq.com/">Pylons</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="zope">
<h4>Zope<a class="headerlink" href="#zope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Zope framework is one of the &#8220;old original&#8221; frameworks.  Its current
incarnation in Zope2 is a tightly integrated full-stack framework.  One of its
most interesting feature is its tight integration with a powerful object
database called the <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/zodb">ZODB</a> (Zope Object Database).
Because of its highly integrated nature, Zope wound up in a somewhat isolated
ecosystem:  code written for Zope wasn&#8217;t very usable outside of Zope, and
vice-versa.  To solve this problem the Zope 3 effort was started.  Zope 3
re-engineers Zope as a set of more cleanly isolated components.  This effort
was started before the advent of the WSGI standard, but there is WSGI support
for Zope 3 from the <a class="reference external" href="http://repoze.org/">Repoze</a> project.  Zope components
have many years of production use behind them, and the Zope 3 project gives
access to these components to the wider Python community.  There is even a
separate framework based on the Zope components: <a class="reference external" href="http://grok.zope.org/">Grok</a>.</p>
<p>Zope is also the infrastructure used by the <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a> content
management system, one of the most powerful and popular content management
systems available.</p>

<p>Another framework that&#8217;s already been mentioned is <a class="reference external" href="http://pylonshq.com/">Pylons</a>.  Pylons is much
like TurboGears, but with an even stronger emphasis on flexibility, which comes
