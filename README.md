MacMiner
========

Mac Bitcoin, Litecoin and alt coin miner GUI interface for mining and monitoring networked miners and the only Objective-C miner GUI.

This project can essentially be downloaded and built immediately in Xcode. You may need to change code signing settings.

Work in progress - if you know your way around Xcode any tips or commits would be much appreciated by me and the community!

The code is not provided here for bfgminer or it's api-example.c which is used to compile apiaccess, neither are cgminer or minerd (pooler's cpuminer) - these are available on github with their respective authors. Binaries are included here for ease of compilation.
